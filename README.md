- 👋 Hi, I’m Lokman Aalioui
- 🌱 I've spent six transformative years in finance & Banking in France, progressing from financial sales to insurance expertise. 
- 💞️ In parallel, my passion for data science led me to a project-based master's degree at an engineering school.
- 📫 But I'm not all numbers and code — my entrepreneurial spirit has fueled multiple e-commerce ventures and graphic design freelancing experiences.

I'm eager to bring my unique blend of skills and experiences to a challenging new role!
