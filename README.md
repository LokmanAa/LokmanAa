- 👋 Hi, I’m @Lokman Aalioui
As someone who thrives at the intersection of data science and banking,
- 🌱 I've spent six transformative years at Crédit Agricole in France,
progressing from financial sales to insurance expertise. In parallel,
- 💞️ my passion for analytics led me to a project-based master's degree in data science at an engineering school.
There, I dived deep into real-world projects like developing credit scoring models.
But I'm not all numbers and code—my entrepreneurial spirit has fueled multiple e-commerce ventures and graphic design freelancing gigs.
- 📫 I even used my creativity to keep team morale high during the COVID-19 pandemic with a homemade newsletter.
I'm eager to bring my unique blend of skills and experiences to a challenging new role!
