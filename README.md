ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Lokman

I have 6 years of experience in finance & banking in France, transitioning from financial sales to insurance risk analysis. Alongside, I pursued a master's degree in data science and completed 13 real-world projects that showcase my skills in machine learning, data visualization, and statistical analysis.

I'm now looking to bring my bank/insurance expertise and data science skills to a challenging role.

Feel free to explore my projects and connect! ðŸ˜Š
